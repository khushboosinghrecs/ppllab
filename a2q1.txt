Q.1. Design a set of simple test programs to determine the type compatibility rules of a C compiler to
which you have access.

Ans:

ompatibility between types refers to the similarity of two types to each other. ... The types unsigned 
short and unsigned short int are the same and are compatible. The types int , signed , and signed int
 are the same and are compatible. The types unsigned and unsigned int are the same and are compatible.


c program:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
t main()
{
    float n1=12.5;
int n2=n1;
    
    printf("%f\n", n1);  //This assigning of float value to int type will result in loss of decimal value of n1. However, this 
                        //type compatibility will not show any error but it might give a warning “possible loss of data”.
    printf("%d\n", n2);
    return 0;
   
    
}

result:
12.500000
