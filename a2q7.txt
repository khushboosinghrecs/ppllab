Q.7. Write a C program that has the following statements:
int a, b;
a = 10;
b = a + fun();
printf("With the function call on the right, ");
printf(" b is: %d\n", b);
a = 10;
b = fun() + a;
printf("With the function call on the left, ");
printf(" b is: %d\n", b);
and define fun to add 10 to a. Explain the results.

ans:

program in c:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int fun(int x)
{
    return x*x;
}

int main()
{
int a, b;
a = 10;
b = a + fun(a);
printf("With the function call on the right, ");
printf(" b is: %d\n", b);
a = 10;
b = fun(a) + a;
printf("With the function call on the left, ");
printf(" b is: %d\n", b);
a=20;
b = fun(a) + a;
printf("With the function call on the left, ");
printf(" b is: %d\n", b);
return 0;
}

result:

With the function call on the right,  b is: 110        // result is same                                                                 
With the function call on the left,  b is: 110   
With the function call on the left,  b is: 240 

analysis: we know on one variable value can be updated so here is the same case .
after first excution the value of a be updated.
